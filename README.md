# Deep Mehta — Data Science | ML | GenAI

## 👋 About Me
I am an early-career **Data Scientist (M.S. Data Science, Pace University, May 2025)** with hands-on experience in **ML, NLP, and GenAI applications**. My work spans from **fine-tuning BERT for document classification (macro-F1 80→94)** to **deploying low-latency RAG pipelines** (200 ms retrieval, +80% throughput) and **building interpretable clustering apps with SHAP**.  

I enjoy transforming raw data into **practical, production-ready systems** — shipping ETL pipelines, ML APIs, and analytics dashboards with Python, FastAPI, Docker, and AWS.  

🔭 **Target roles:** Data Scientist (Associate/I), Applied ML Engineer (Entry), NLP/LLM Data Scientist

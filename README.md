# Deep Mehta — Data Science | ML | GenAI

## 👋 About Me
I’m a **Data Scientist & AI Engineer** who loves turning raw data into **production-ready ML systems**.  
From **data ingestion and modeling** to **deployment and monitoring**, I thrive on building pipelines and applications that move seamlessly from prototype to scale.

🔍 **Recent focus areas:**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with sub-second retrieval  
- Explainable clustering apps powered by SHAP  
- AI-powered study assistants that combine NLP + usability  

⚡ **What drives me:** making ML not just accurate, but **fast, interpretable, and user-friendly**.  
Whether it’s an ETL pipeline, an ML API, or an analytics dashboard, I build with **Python, FastAPI, Docker, and AWS** to deliver solutions that create real impact.

🔭 **Target roles:** Data Scientist (Associate/I), Applied ML Engineer (Entry), NLP/LLM Data Scientist

# **Deep Mehta — AI Engineer | Generative AI | RAG & LLM Systems**

## 👋 About Me

I’m an **AI Engineer** who builds **production-grade generative AI and retrieval systems** — not prototypes with no impact.

I specialize in:

* Architecting and operating **production RAG pipelines** for real-time semantic search
* Designing **LLM routing and grounding systems** with reliability and observability
* Building **scalable backend APIs** for AI workflows using FastAPI and async patterns
* Evaluating LLMs for **cost, latency, and consistency**

🔭 **Current Focus:**
Production RAG, LLM routing & query classification, LLM evaluation metrics, multi-agent orchestration

🚀 **Target Roles:**
AI Engineer · Generative AI Engineer · LLM / RAG Systems Engineer · Applied Machine Learning Engineer
